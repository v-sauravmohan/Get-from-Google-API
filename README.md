# Get from Google API

Acts as an interface between an Application and an API. 
Fetches data from the API provided by Google and supplies it to an application.

# Usecase
In Case of the Angular CLI, it provides a development server that runs on localhost:4200 by default so if you are using an API that runs on a different domain, you may have CORS issues. In order to overcome this issue, We can fetch the data from the API through this Backend service, then use this data in the Front end Application.

### Installation

 Get from Google API requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

### Execution

Run the app using the following command.

```sh
$ npm start
